# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on identifying fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. Given the significant imbalance in the dataset, various preprocessing, sampling, and modeling strategies were implemented to improve detection accuracy, especially for minority (fraudulent) classes.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used in this project was sourced from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dazzle-nu/CIS435-CreditCardFraudDetection). It contains anonymized credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or legitimate.

- **Total records:** 1,048,575 transactions  
- **Fraudulent records:** 1,825  
- **Legitimate records:** 1,046,750

Each transaction includes:
- Anonymized features (V1‚ÄìV28)
- `Time` and `Amount`
- `Class`: the target label (0 = legitimate, 1 = fraud)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

### 1. **Data Exploration (EDA)**
- Analyzed class distribution and imbalance
- Visualized feature distributions using histograms and boxplots

### 2. **Preprocessing**
- Normalized `Amount` and `Time`
- Removed original `Time` column after transformation
- Split data into training and testing sets

### 3. **Handling Imbalance**
- Applied **Under-sampling** to balance the training dataset

### 4. **Modeling**
Implemented and evaluated multiple machine learning models:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

### 5. **Evaluation Metrics**
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- ROC-AUC
- Classification Report

## üìà Results

| Model               | Precision | Recall | F1-Score  | ROC-AUC   |
| ------------------- | --------- | ------ | --------- | --------- |
| Logistic Regression | High      | High   | Good      | Good      |
| Decision Tree       | Very High | High   | Excellent | Excellent |
| Random Forest       | Very High | High   | Excellent | Excellent |
| XGBoost             | Very High | High   | Excellent | Excellent |

- Tree-based models (especially XGBoost) showed superior performance in detecting fraud.
- Focus was placed on optimizing **recall** to minimize false negatives.
